# dits
A collection of useful [dit classes](https://github.com/isaiahshiner/dit-cli) to be imported into other dits.

Link these in dits like this:

    import SomeNamespace 'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/isaiahshiner/dits/master/dits/Number.dit';

Feel free to make pull requests with your own useful dits classes, for any situation or purpose. The shareability of dit resources is one of the key features of dit.

Eventually, this repository will morph into a dedicated app on [the website](https://www.ditabase.io/) where each class has it's own repo page with issues, collaboration, and links to other dits that use that class. Think of that app like mashing GitHub and Schema.org.
