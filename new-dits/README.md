These dits are based on the new style dits planned for the upcoming 0.5 release.
Primarily, they have first class functions which you can use for anything and write
anywhere, not just validate and print. All other changes <|Like triangle (|and circle|)
expressions|> are in service of that fundamental feature.

When dit-cli 0.5 releases, new-dits will change over and replace the dits folder.
